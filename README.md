# Welcome to Libero Reviewer

[The Product Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/NShRx4VE/libero-reviewer-product-roadmap)
for Libero Reviewer has been revisted after the launch of libero.pub site. This roadmap
combined with the site sets out the objectives and our commitments for the product vision.

We are a part of the [Coko Community](https://coko.foundation/partners/) and
as such committed to sharing our components with the rest of the publishing via
this community.

The aim of the PoC is to demonstrate an implementation a widely used and mature framework for
all the heavylifting for solving the technical issues (don't reinvent the wheel).
With the aim of sharing domain-specific components (Publishing) via PubSweet for
the rest of the community to benefit from.

## Quick Start

The development environment uses a number of `docker-compose` files to bootstrap it's services and infrastructure. To get started from fresh, run the setup task

```sh
make setup
```

This will setup the .scripts submodule as well as create configuration files for each service and run `yarn install`.

Then run start task:
```sh
make start
```

Behind the scenes docker-compose will start the infrastructure services (postgres, rabbitmq etc) described in `docker-compose.infra.yml` then it'll wait for those services to startup properly, and then it'll start the libero services described in `docker-compose.yml` and attaches to the logs generated by these services.

To stop reviewer, simply run the stop task
```sh
make stop
```

## Other commands

You can run the clean_config task to clear all the configuration files
```sh
make clean_config
```

The clean_databases task will clear all the database volumes
```sh
make clean_databases
```

Run the integration tests using headless chrome.
```sh
make test_integration
```
