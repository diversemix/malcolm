# Welcome to Libero Reviewer

[The Product Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/NShRx4VE/libero-reviewer-product-roadmap)
for Libero Reviewer has been revisted after the launch of libero.pub site. This roadmap
combined with the site sets out the objectives and our commitments for the product vision.

We are a part of the [Coko Community](https://coko.foundation/partners/) and
as such committed to sharing our components with the rest of the publishing via
this community.

The aim of the PoC is to demonstrate an implementation a widely used and mature framework for
all the heavylifting for solving the technical issues (don't reinvent the wheel).
With the aim of sharing domain-specific components (Publishing) via PubSweet for
the rest of the community to benefit from.

## Quick Start

The development environment uses a number of `docker-compose` files to bootstrap it's services and infrastructure. To get started from fresh, do the following:

```bash
./start.sh
```

Behind the scenes `make start_services` will start the infrastructure services (postgres, rabbitmq etc) described in `docker-compose.infra.yml` then it'll wait for those services to startup properly, and then it'll start the libero services described in `docker-compose.yml` and attaches to the logs generated by these services.

Another commonly used make command for developers, runs the CI locally:
```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
make local_ci
```

NOTE: Ensure that the `.scripts` folder is now updated with the git submodule commands.

## Documentation

All documents relevant to this project can be found in the [`docs`](docs/) folder within the repository.
